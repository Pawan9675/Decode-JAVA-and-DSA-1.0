/*
EXPLANATION:
-> We do a certain number of passes(n-1) and in every pass,
   we compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are not in correct order.
-> In every iteration, the largest number in part of array to be processed gets its correct position.

TIME COMPLEXITY:
-> Worst Case
    - O(N^2)
    - Number of Comparisons: O(N^2) time
    - Number of swaps: O(N^2) time

-> Average Case
    - Î˜(N^2)
    - Number of Comparisons: O(N^2) time
    - Number of swaps: O(N^2) time

-> Best Case
    - O(N)
    - Number of Comparisons: N = O(N) time
    - Number of swaps: 0 = O(1) time

SPACE COMPLEXITY - O(1).

Maximum no of swaps in worst case in Bubble Sort - n(n-1)/2.

Is Bubble sort stable? - YES.

Is Bubble Sort an in-place algorithm? - YES (O(1)).

Bubble sort is also known as Sinking sort or Exchange sort.
